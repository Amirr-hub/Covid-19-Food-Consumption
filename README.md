# Effects of Covid-19 on Food Consumption
This project explores how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced consumer spending on food in the U.S. from 2020 to 2021. Using Tableau, I cleaned and visualized data to uncover both immediate and longer-term trends. The dashboard highlights notable shifts, including a sales spike in early 2020 followed by a significant decline in 2021, with "Meats and Poultry" experiencing the most volatility. The analysis offers insight into changing consumer behavior and supports strategic planning in retail and supply chain sectors.
